        ANTI-INJECTION ARCHITECTURE NOTE (unchanged):
        User arguments are appended as positional args to ``sh -c`` and consumed
        via ``"$@"``; ``shlex.join`` quotes them so ``sh`` treats them as literal
        strings, immune to ``$()`` / ``\\n`` expansion. The ``sh -c`` exists to
        emit the PGID (``echo $$``) for precise lifecycle/timeout kills.

        Two modes:
        * ``run_log_path is None`` (non-logged): output streams back over the SSH
          channel (``asyncssh.PIPE``), as before — these commands are short and
          their output IS the result.
        * ``run_log_path`` set (logged, e.g. ansible): the run's stdout/stderr
          are severed from the SSH channel (redirected to ``/dev/null``) and
          stdin detached (``< /dev/null``). This is what lets the run SURVIVE
          deploy-service going away — its output no longer flows through the SSH
          channel, so closing that channel can't SIGPIPE-cascade the process to
          death (the exit-141 bug). The run script itself ``tee``s its output to
          the control_node log file, and the viewer/heal read that file over a
          separate SSH connection, so nothing is lost. (We redirect to
          ``/dev/null`` rather than the log file precisely so we don't
          double-write the file the script already owns.)

          A two-line stderr handshake is emitted BEFORE exec (so it reaches the
          channel even though exec's output is redirected): the PGID, then a
          literal ``READY``. ``_execute_pipeline`` waits for ``READY`` to confirm
          the command actually reached exec — if it never arrives (script not
          found, log dir unwritable, etc.) the run is a start-up failure and is
          reported as such instead of hanging in RUNNING (blind-spot B).
