"""kill_command must never strand a command in KILLING.

Bug found in manual testing: a `killable: false` run, when the service shuts
down (shutdown_gracefully → kill_command), was flipped to KILLING and then
returned early *without* transitioning to KILLED — leaving it stuck at KILLING
forever, even after docker finished on the control_node and wrote its marker.

Two guarantees:
  1. A non-killable command is never moved to KILLING (nothing to kill).
  2. Any command that does enter KILLING is reconciled by the marker heal
     (see test_command_orphan_heal for the heal of KILLING).
