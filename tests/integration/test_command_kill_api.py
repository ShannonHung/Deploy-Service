"""The kill endpoint must not lie.

Found in manual testing: POST /execution/{id}/kill on a RUNNING command that is
`killable: false` returned `{"status": "accepted", "message": "Kill request
accepted"}` — but the service correctly refused to kill it (it's non-killable),
so nothing happened. The 'accepted' response was misleading. A non-killable
command must be rejected up front with a 409, mirroring the existing
"wrong state" rejection.
